How Many Days Til
==================

This is a simple application built using ASP.NET MVC 4 that allows users to track important dates. A user can either import an .ICS file or manually add dates once they have logged in through Facebook or Twitter. The site will then tell the user how many days are left til that date. Dates can be edited or deleted by the user.

You can see the actual site at http://www.howmanydaystil.com.

This site will be the base upon other applications will be built on. I wanted a common theme/site to teach myself Windows 8 programming, iOS development and Android development.


Roadmap
==================
This site itself will mostly remain unchanged. First up on my plate is a Windows 8 application followed by an iOS application and Android application.
